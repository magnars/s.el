# s.el [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/magnars/s.el.png)](http://travis-ci.org/magnars/s.el)

The long lost Emacs string manipulation library.

## Installation

It's available on [marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and [Melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):

    M-x package-install s

Or you can just dump `s.el` in your load path somewhere.

## Functions

[[ function-list ]]

## Documentation and examples

[[ function-docs ]]

## What's with the built-in wrappers?

Imagine looking through the function list and seeing `s-ends-with?`, but
`s-starts-with?` is nowhere to be found. Why? Well, because Emacs already has
`string-prefix-p`. Now you're starting out slightly confused, then have to go
somewhere else to dig for the command you were looking for.

The wrapping functions serve as both documentation for existing functions and
makes for a consistent API.

## Contribute

Yes, please do. There's a suite of tests, so remember to add tests for your
specific feature, or I might break it later.

You'll find the repo at:

    https://github.com/magnars/s.el

**Looking for work?** Here are some features we would like:

 - `(s-center 80 s)` pads s with spaces to center the string.
 - `(s-distance s1 s2)` calculates Levenshtein distance between s1 and s2

## Development

Run the tests with

    ./run-tests.sh

Create the docs with

    ./create-docs.sh

I highly recommend that you install these as a pre-commit hook, so that
the tests are always running and the docs are always in sync:

    cp pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit

Oh, and don't edit `README.md` directly, it is auto-generated.
Change `readme-template.md` or `examples-to-docs.el` instead.
